Scope:America’s Unique Gun Violence
Objective:
Ref Data Product: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts

1.0	This article provides intuitive visual information and statistics on the topic of America’s unique gun violence problem. United States is amongst the handful of nations where gun possession is constitutionally protected. The article focuses on the following issues related to gun violence in the U.S.:
a)	Firearm homicides compared with other developed countries: America has far more firearm homicides than any other developed country in the world. Compared to Canada its six times and compared to Germany its sixteen times more. As per research by Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, more number of firearms is the reason behind such outlier as far as gun homicides are concerned. 
b)	Deaths due to firearms: Number of gun deaths in a state is strongly correlated with number of guns. A ton of research has supported the idea that easy access to gun increases the death risk proportionately. Most of the gun deaths in America are due to suicides not mass shootings. 
c)	Causes of Gun Deaths: Though it’s quite intuitive that higher populations, stress, more immigrants, and more mental illness might be the reason behind gun deaths ; but as per the research by economist Richard Florida  gun deaths are more related to gun control laws in the states rather than these issues.
d)	Most gun deaths are suicides: Guns are an easy way to consider suicide. As per research in various countries, restricting access to guns can help drop firearm suicides significantly.
e)	Police officer’s death in gun homicides: Researchers are able to find strong positive correlation between gun owners and numbers of police officers death in homicides. The findings clarify why US police officers appear to kill more people than cops in other developed countries 
f)	Gun Violence is decreasing: Gun violence has declined over the decade and research is going on to discover its reason. Some of the reasons that researchers have come up with are mass imprisonment, more and better policing, and diminished lead exposure from gasoline. But researchers have widely denied the idea that more gun access is the reason of these drop, instead some research has supported the opposite idea.
g)	Correlation between gun control laws and gun violence: Studies have shown states with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun related deaths. 

h)	Public Opinion:
As a result of major mass shootings receiving more press attention, a shift has occurred in Americans from the concept of gun control towards the right to own guns.
As per the survey by Pew Research Center, mass shootings have little effect on public opinion about the right to own guns. Although most Americans want to protect their right to own firearms, most also support specific gun control policies such as stronger background verifications, a database to track gun sales, and banning assault-style weapons. However, whenever this kind of policies are proposed they are spun as an endeavor to take away the right to own guns by politician and pundits. So, at the end, things stay the same and nothing is accomplished towards gun control policies.

2.0	Where & Why Effective/Ineffective: 
This data product is effective in showcasing America’s uniqueness in gun related violence through various studies and statistics. Its effective in showing how gun related deaths are related to easy access to gun through several suitable visual examples such as how access to guns are related to suicides, how gun-control laws and policies have the ability to bring significant drop in gun deaths, strong correlation between more guns in states and police officers killed on duty. All above mentioned points are supported by charts that provide sufficient statistical evidence to prove those points.

However, I found the data product ineffective in few aspects. First, the articles mention public support has increased towards “right to own gun” in spite of high-profile shootings and also provides visual information about this increase. However, is it a sense of security, is it status quo or is it mere sense of adventure; the article does not say anything about what makes people to own a gun. Furthermore, it does not give any statistic about demographics of people that have committed gun violence. Article also mentions politicians are tweaking the proposals to specific gun control policies to sound like policies are being framed to take away your guns. So, I in my opinion article is ineffective in establishing causality for Public Opinion (what makes people to own a gun) , how politicians are tweaking gun control policies upon their proposal

3.0	Redesign:
First redesign would be to make few charts more intuitive to understand. One graph that I felt more complicated to understand visually was “Control gun ownership” vs “Protect right to own guns” (Chart No.16) which can be simplified into another set of charts/ graphs which will give clear picture comparing each state. Another one that can be simplified is “Gun ownership vs Gun Deaths” chart(-5) where more information can be provided without overcrowding the chart space. The same principal can be applied to “Developed countries with more guns also have more gun deaths” chart(6).
 
Another redesign that would make sense is superimposing “Tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths” map(8) with “Gun ownership vs Gun Deaths” map(5) and “Mass shootings map” -map(3) all on the same map. This would provide more information from three different aspects.
 
Similar to above we can combine the country specific data into one chart.  “Developed countries with more guns also have more gun deaths—map(6)” and “America is an outlier when it comes to gun deaths, but not overall crime—map(7)”.
 
4.0	Deceptive Version:
4.1	In Map 9 the y-axis is homicide death per 100,000. However, in map 10 the y-axis is homicide death per 2,000 people. So, if we consider Firearm suicides versus homicides chart (chart 10) for per 100,000 people instead of 2,000 people there will be negligible difference between firearm suicides versus firearm homicides. So we can create a deceptive version of chart-10 by minimizing magnifying scale of Y axis.
4.2	For chart-15 (i.e. support for gun ownership has sharply increased since the early 2000s); if we take slice of data i.e. if we consider 2010 onwards we can say that support for control gun ownership and support for protecting rights is almost the same. So here we can create a deceptive version of peoples control gun ownership and support for protecting rights by slicing data.
4.3         For map-1(homicides by firearm per 1 million people chart), the article considers only the developed countries. However, in case we add other developing countries, especially ones that have higher rate of homicides due to gun violence, then US would not be among the top. So that can provide a deceptive version by adding more countries .
