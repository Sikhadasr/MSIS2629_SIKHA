    "1.0 The vox article \"America’s unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts(Ref https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) provides intuitive visual information and statistics on the topic of America’s unique gun violence problem. United States is amongst the handful of nations where gun possession is constitutionally protected. The article focuses on the various issues related to gun violence in the U.S.such as\tFirearm homicides compared with other developed countries, Deaths due to firearms, Different causes of Gun Deaths ,Correlation between gun control laws and gun violenc,Public Opinion on different topics of gun violence. \n",

    "\n",
    "(will be referred as **Principles of Analytical Design** hereafter in the dataproduct)\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal #1: Comparisons: Show comparisons, contrasts, and differences. Vizualization is meant for compare, contrast and find differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal #2  Causality, mechanism, explanation: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, and systematic structure.  How was the information that is represented caused? What are the sources of differences and variability in the measurements?\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal #3 Multivariate Analysis: Show multivariate analysis; that is show more than 1 or 2 variables. Don’t use one column, add multiple variables, by adding axis, bringing multiple data source, refine data, slice data ,manipulate  data, wrangle dataDepicting the conditions under which a cause and effect occur quickly becomes multivariate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Principal #4 Integration of Evidence: If you need to have causality you need to bring multiple data sources together. Integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams, graphics, charts, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Principal #5 DocumentationThoroughly describe the evidence. Provide a detailed title, indicate the authors and sponsors, document the data sources, show complete measurement scales, point out relevant issues. Credibility, bias, and responsibility of authorship must be taken into account when accessing evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal #6 Relevance:Analytical presentations ultimately stand and fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.**An Argumentation Model**:(Ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulmin_method)\n",
    "(will be referred as **An Argumentation Model** hereafter in the dataproduct)\n",
    "Tt involves the grounds (data), claim, and warrant of an argument. These three parts of the argument are all necessary to support a good argument. The grounds are the evidence used to prove a claim. The warrant is the assumption or principle that connects the grounds to the claim. All three parts are critical to achieving rhetorical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**Goal-Questions-Metrics (GQM) approach**:(Ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM)\n",
    "(will be referred as **GQM** hereafter in the dataproduct)\n",
    "GQM defines a  model on three levels\n",
    "Conceptual level (Goal) \n",
    "A goal is defined for an object, for a variety of reasons, with respect to various models of quality, from various points of view and relative to a particular environment.\n",
    "Operational level (Question) \n",
    "A set of questions is used to define models of the object of study and then focuses on that object to characterize the assessment or achievement of a specific goal.\n",
    "Quantitative level (Metric) \n",
    "A set of metrics, based on the models, is associated with every question in order to answer it in a measurable way.\n",

    "**Making of Revised Redesign of Chart-6**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Redesign vs Revised Redesign**:Considering the following flaws in my first redesign versions i considered the revision:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.In my 1st redesign I considred all the countries. However, As per the claim the comparison we want to make is between two groups of developed countries(with Higher and low gun ownership) and how firearm  deaths vary in these two groups of developed countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the revised redesign I would like to  focus the graph on the comparison we want to make. I would  group  developed countries into two groups one with 'HIGHER GUN OWNERSHIP' and one with 'LOWER GUN OWNERSHIP' and see GUN RELATED DEATHS(PER 100,000 PEOPLE)' vary in these two groups of developed countries.(as per GQM approach which says metric should match the goal)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.For many countries France, like though gun ownership is high but homicide by firearm is less compared to countries with less firearm ownership like Italy, Belgium etc which leaves a scope for rebuttal.So dividing into only two groups will help remove this scope.(address fear of audience as per Audience Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the first version, i used two bar charts in one bar chart ‘Average firearms per 100 people for developed countries and ‘Homicide by firearm rate per 100,000 pop  for developed countries in the other. Instead of two charts I would use one chart for ease of comparison(Principle 4 of Analytical Design & also )\n",
    "\n",
    "4.I used raw rate. This time I would like to take to take refined/transforemd data for vizualization since the chart made with the refined data will take me closer to my claim.(Multivariate Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "5.I used only one firearm homicide dataset in my first redesign.To make the claim more stronger thorough integration of evidence,  i would like to integrate the my previous dataset with Total firearm deaths to consider not only homicide death but total firearm death(Principle 4 of Analytical Design). \n",
    "\n",
    "6. There was no proper tiltle in the 1st redesign of chart-6. I would include proper title in my revised version(Principle 5 of Analytical Design)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience**: Audience for my revised redesign is Gun control advocacy groups in the United States whose goal is to decresse gun ownership and increase tighter gun control laws.(want of audience as per audience model)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim for redesign**:Not just the US: Developed countries with more guns also have more gun deaths, which is in line with the want of the audience(as per audience model)\n",
